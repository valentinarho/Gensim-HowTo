# Help me with...

The aim of this repository is to collect some useful how-tos, snippets or notes related to
modern libraries, languages or generally computer science topics. 
I started from Gensim Python library but I plan to introduce more topics and I hope others will contribute with theirs.

## To contribute

Check if your resource file already exists:

* If yes, feel free to add any useful information to it.
* If no, create the `your-resource.md` file.


## Additional data

The `data` folder contains useful data to support examples and snippets.
Create a subfolder for each Markdown file, with the same name.
